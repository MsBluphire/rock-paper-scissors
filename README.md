# rock-paper-scissors
Created to classes Stubborn AI and Short AttentionSpanAI to play the rock-paper-scissors game
Implemented an interface IPlayer that would be able to used by both new classes created. 
StubbornAI will consistently return the same move each time, it is utilized in the game. 
ShortAttentionSpanAI will consistently return a move that would have beat it's opponent's previous move.
